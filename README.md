# Canada Tech Employment Analysis (2011-2025)

A comprehensive R-based analysis of technology sector employment trends in Canada, covering the period from 2011 to 2025. This project provides detailed insights into employment patterns, growth rates, unemployment trends, and advanced statistical analysis for Canada's technology sectors.

## Project Overview

This analysis examines employment data for two major technology sectors in Canada:
- **Professional & Technical Services**: Including software development, IT consulting, and technical services
- **Information & Culture**: Including telecommunications, media, and information services

The project uses Statistics Canada data to provide insights into employment trends, seasonal patterns, growth volatility, and forecasting for strategic planning and policy development.
